<p>Today, brands are using innovative ways to increase the dialogue with their customer. Interactive Video is one such platform that enhances customer engagement and helps brands improve their visib</p>
<p>A quick look at how brands are using interactive videos to their benefit.</p>
<p><b>Awareness Videos</b></p>
<p>Interactive Video is a powerful tool for brand impact. Based on research, 84% of consumers felt interactive video formats boosted their opinion of the brand versus 64% for standard pre-roll. It gives the opportunity to gather the customer data which you cannot do otherwise on a platform like youtube.  Interactivity lets the viewers discover and consume content at their own pace.</p>
<p><b>Educational videos</b></p>
<p>It is one of the most compelling uses of Interactive Videos. One can present the information to viewers based on their knowledge or interest. It can be used to give tips to the viewer’s problem, while you gather the data to contact them later for a specific solution.</p>
<p>It can also be used for employee training and education. It can integrate with company’s internal system for compliance and onboarding training</p>
<p><b>Turn prospects into Leads</b></p>
<p>Content in today’s time cannot be one size fits all. The interactive videos give you the freedom to provide specific content to the viewers with a feature to take inputs from them.</p>
<p>Questions can be asked real time and the data gathered can be used at the backend. This data can help to determine the viewers who are interested and have a need. Also, we can gauge which viewers may not have the immediate need but can be converted at a later date.</p>
<p><b>Repurpose a webinar video</b></p>
<p>An existing webinar can be converted into Interactive Video to engage with the audience. The webinars can be enriched with questions for viewers to answer. Such webinars can be uploaded to the company’s resource gallery to watch later</p>
<p><b>Pre-demo discovery video</b></p>
<p>An Interactive questionnaire can be used to collect information and based on the insights the demo can be personalized. A short and to the point interactive video from the sales team will suffice.</p>
<p><b>Training videos</b></p>
<p>Adding quizzes, activities to the training video can make them far more effective. Such interactive training engages audience 10X better rather than passively just watching a lecture. It can be customized to individual skill sets to enhance the learning experience.</p>
