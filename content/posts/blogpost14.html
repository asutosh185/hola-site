<p>With the advent of 2018 around the corner, it is time to plan for the new 
strategies for digital marketing. The plans and strategies successful in 
2017 may not be relevant in 2018. Let’s see what creates a high impact 
on your customers and your business in 2018. </p>
<p><strong>MicroMoments:</strong> Micro moments occur when someone turn to their 
smart phone to do something specific. It could be to do some research, 
to find a location or to buy something. In these micromoments, the 
consumers make decision and form preferences. These are the highly 
critical touch points where brands can impact the customer decision. 
Most of the time these micro moments occurs when people are 
travelling, waiting in the queue or visiting a store to make a purchase. 
 In 2018, the successful brands will have the strategy to understand and 
meet the consumer needs in these micro moments.  </p>

<p><strong>Visualization:</strong> Emphasis on visualization remains the same as in 2017. 
If we revisit the past statistics, 59 percent of executives would rather 
watch video than read text while four times as many consumers would 
rather watch a video about a product then read about it. 
Seventy-four percent of millennial find video helpful when 
comparison-shopping, 60 percent prefer to watch a video to reading a 
newsletter. </p>

<p>Consumers are able to relate and engage to the visual content better 
than the text. Visuals will help you drive more leads causing higher sales 
and thus contributing to your bottom line.  </p>
<p><strong>Chatbots:</strong> A service run by artificial intelligence and it mimics human 
while interacting with the customer over a chat interface. See how 
chatbots are going to change the game in the next few years: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Chatbots are expected to increase cost-savings in billions of 
dollars a year in ecommerce, banking and healthcare. </li>
	<li>Chatbot interaction is expected to increase from just 20% in 
2017 to 93% in 2022.</li>
	<li>Businesses are increasing their interactivity with other 
businesses within a chatbot experience.</li>
	<li>In 2018, it’s estimated that 30% of interactions with tech will be 
conversation-based and 2018 is shoring up to be the “year of the 
voicebot.” </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Smart Content:</strong> With the advent of 2018, generic content will be the 
thing of the past. The content personalized as to the consumer’s need 
will be creating demand i.e the content that can be tailored and delivered 
according to the prospect’s buying cycle stage. With the customer 
becoming more demanding and the rise of the competition, one size fit 
all theory will not work anymore. To be able to get more customer attention and engagement, smart content is the only answer. A research 
conducted by Hubspot shows, calls-to-action targeted to the user 
performed 42% better than calls-to-action that were generic.  
It is worthwhile spending time and energy to make the existing content 
smarter or creating a new generation of intelligent content. </p>
<p><strong>Geo-targeting/Geolocation Marketing:</strong> Next thing to look out for in 
2018 is Geo-location targeting and marketing. It is another form of 
personalized marketing which is tailored according to the location of the 
prospects. Based on the user location, only the local ads can be 
displayed. In Geo-location marketing, the brands can target mobile 
users. The customized push notification about an attractive offer can be 
sent as soon as they are in the nearby area. </p>
