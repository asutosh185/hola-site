          <p>Smartphones and use of internet on them, have gained popularity like
            wildfire. Books, newspapers and TV have been replaced with reading
            on the Internet. News, articles, watching movies, job hunting and even
            buying property is being done online.

          <p>A recent report published by Internet And Mobile Association of India
            (IAMAI) and KPMG predicts a mind boggling growth of mobile internet
            users in India, lets look at some stats:

            <li>Number of users reaching 314 million by 2017.</li>
            <li>With mobile internet gaining ground it is also predicted that use of
              2G network will decline and 3G and 4G networks will become more popular
              among the users.</li>
            <li>This change in the internet usage spectrum is not just true for urban
              India. The movement has caught on in rural India as well. In rural
              India, 52 per cent users accessed the Internet for entertainment,
              39 per cent for social networking, 37 per cent for communication
              and only 1 per cent for online shopping.</li>
            <li>The mobile internet user base reached 306 million by December 2015,
              and is expected to touch 371 million users by June 2016, a rise of
              21 per cent in six months!</li>

          </p>
          <p>A news article in Quartz India reveals the astonishing fact that India
            has overtaken US to become the second largest smartphone market in
            the world. In fact, India has more number of people with smartphones
            than the number of people with desktop. SMS, email, banking services
            and social networking are most commonly used on the smartphones. Smartphones
            are becoming easily available with many domestic manufacturers providing
            high-end phones at low costs. The Digital India movement is also making
            Internet readily available for use on phones.</p>
          <p>According to a study by Google and Nielsen on an average consumers spend
            more than 15 hours a week on smartphones. With the mobile internet
            revolution of sorts, how can smart phones, not be the primary medium
            for organization to advertise and market their products and services?

          </p>
          <p>While SMS has been the default way of reaching to mobile audience, it
            cannot utilize the hardware of a smart phone effectively. A video advertisement
            takes away the limitations of an SMS, while leveraging the intrinsic
            characteristics of a smartphone such touch screen, telephony, and location
            proximity among others. Think about it – sitting in the metro, a message
            is received and instead of reading text you have a link. Clicking the
            link takes you to a beautiful animated audio visual that talks about
            a product in the market. Entertainment and information all at the same
            time in a nutshell, without having to read a lot of text.</p>
          <p>While email advertising has been around for more than a decade, as smartphones
            gain popularity among the consumers it is very important to customize
            the ads to multiple screens to cater to the varied sizes of smartphones.
            It is irksome to watch a nice video of a product one wants to “learn
            more” about, but receive either a tiny version of it or view the video
            half cut. Modifying the videos to reach maximum audience base is the
            key to a successful campaign.

          </p>
          <p>MMS could have been a wonderful medium, but given the challenges around
            the technology adoption and different screen resolutions, it never
            could be leveraged as a marketing channel. In-app advertisements need
            apps to be installed and there is now a fatigue setting in to install
            any new app.</p>
          <p>Smart Marketers are now trying out new and innovative channels to address
            this very specific need of trying to reach a large audience on their
            mobile, using rich graphics. The compelling need is to capture the
            mobile internet user base, as it can increase the chances of your success
            three fold.
