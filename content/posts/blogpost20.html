<p>The content needs are changing rapidly. People are moving towards bite-sized, to the point content, preferably on demand. Interactive video demand is escalating as it helps to keep the engagement level of the viewers very high. </p>
<p>There are varieties of interactive videos that you can put to good use for your organization:</p>
<p><b>Awareness video: </b></p>
<p>The awareness stage is the top of the funnel or the first step to a sale. Such awareness videos are created to grab your audience attention.</p>
<p>These videos make potential customers aware that you exist and how you can solve their problems. </p>
<p>Awareness videos can be your brand story, educational videos, documentaries, entertaining or emotional videos & explainer videos.</p>
<p><b>Engagement video: </b></p>
<p>Interactive videos allow you to customize the user experience, entertain them and keep them more engaged. It is essential for businesses to focus on different ways to create a dialogue with their customers. Such videos take customer engagement to the next level and nurture the relationship with your customers.</p>
<p>For example, Post-event wrap-up with an in-video satisfaction survey to attendees.</p>
<p><b>Conversion video: </b></p>
<p>Convert your viewers into buyers using interactive videos. Features like buttons and links help to redirect your viewers to another website or an app, place the product in the shopping cart, download brochures, fill-out forms or link to another video. It helps in generating leads and increasing your email list.</p>
