          <p>Successful Marketing is how well you tell your story. The rise in competition
            and shortening of time spent on each article online, has marketers
            shifting towards video marketing. Marketers need to be conscious about
            customers’ time, especially when there is significant shift towards
            content consumption on smart phones. The biggest advantage of a video
            is the power to convey more in less time. If the message is not conveyed
            in time the audience is bound to flip the page. The potential opportunity
            of building a meaningful relationship with a prospect is lost, and
            maybe for ever.</p>

          <p>Though text still remains a big medium of communicating with customers,
            videos have steadily taken over the internet. And there is a good reason
            for it. Reading certainly is tedious and takes time. Audio visuals
            narrate a story with more action and less text. The impact of such
            communication is more. Edgar Dale, an American educationalist, developed
            the Cone of Experience. This model describes how well a human brain
            can retain information provided in different forms. From the cone it
            is clear that when the viewers can watch and listen to our story there
            is a higher probability of understanding and recalling the message.</p>
          <p>Many other researches show that video is a powerful mode of communication.
            Statistics revealed in a compelling report by Invodo, gives a good
            insight on popularity of videos in marketing and purchase decisions.
            Some interesting points are noted here:


            <li>In a blog post, Twitter reveals that photos and videos have a great
              impact on the success of a tweet.</li>
            <li>According to a report by Citrix in 2014, video accounted for 52% of
              all mobile traffic.
            </li>
            <li>In a survey done by Animoto, comparison shopping and post-purchase
              videos were found to be helpful by 93% of consumers.</li>
            <li>In a forecast for 2014-2019, Cisco has predicted video to represent
              80% of all traffic in 2019.</li>
            <li>“In an eye-mapping study of Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs), video
              results commanded more attention than other listings.” – according
              to a KissMetrics Blog.</li>
            <li>“ Video in email can boost open rates by 20% and increase click-through
              rates 2-3X” – from Silverpop’s Digital marketing University, NYC.</li>
          </p>
          <p>The above statistics prove the need for marketers to make video marketing
            integral to their marketing plan. One challenge with videos is the
            next step is not connected to the video. Marketers need to offer a
            smooth transition from the information to action. When call to actions
            are placed right where the information is, it is easier for the viewers
            to take that action. </p>
          <p>There is no doubt that video is changing the way organizations market
            the products and services. The increased popularity of this medium
            is for a good reason for both customers and organizations. So go ahead,
            make a more emphatic impression on your prospects, tell your story
            through a video.</p>
