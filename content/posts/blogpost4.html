          <p>The Pharma and Healthcare industry is yet to take the digital pill.</p>
          <p>While some early adopters are going Digital with focus on providing better outreach to the patients,
            the other unexplored areas of using Digital medium could be awareness creation,
            patient education and steam lining operations to name a few opportunities.

          </p>
          <!--more-->
          <p>With increased availability of smart phones and data bandwidth even in interior parts of the country,
            Digital medium will play an important part of content dissemination. Increased
            presence on Social media helps Pharma companies reach out to their target audience by providing
            information about their products.

          </p>
          <p>However, posting simple textual content is no longer attractive, posting visual content captures
            the attention and conveys the message more effectively.
            While videos are heavy plain static images can tell only half the story.
            This is exactly where Hola Card can help.</p>

          </p>
          <p>These animations can be distributed over SMS, email, Whatsapp or any other Social media platforms.
            Rich analytics help you understand the target audience better.</p>
          <p>Listed below are a few use cases:
            <li>A pharma giant is looking to relaunch their wellness product, used Hola to explain their advantages.
              Customers simply need to give a missed call to a number, provided on the package or in the doctor’s office.
              They receive the customized Hola card link as an SMS. The card has all the details of the cream that can guide the customers to purchase the product.
              For more information, the customers can also download the brochure right from the card.</li>
            <li>Fine prints also make it difficult for the patients to read the usage, dosage and side effects instructions on different medicine packaging. Hola card has now provided a similar missed call solution for this problem to a Pharma company. It also eliminates any language related limitations</li>
            <li>Hola cards is helping another Pharma company, to spread the word about its business in India and abroad. The potential clients of this firm can receive a message through SMS or on WhatsApp with the Hola card link. The card provides details about not only the product, but also the organization and its pricing</li>
            <li>A reputed eye care institute is using Hola cards to educate its patients regarding pre- and post-operative precautions and providing them services like medicine reminders and appointment booking. The audio visual enabled Hola cards explain the patients the dos and don’ts related to surgery. This digital solution also helps the organization in saving money spent on the brochures or pamphlets to distribute to the patients for the surgery related information.</li>
          </p>
          <p>It is easier and faster to register and recall audio visual information than just reading. Hola cards present this advantage over the traditional methods of dissipating information and helping organizations in their digital transformation.</p>
