<p>Many marketers still struggle with the right social media strategy that can help
build a better and more engaging presence. </p>
<p>Below are 5 secrets to a better and more engaging social media presence. </p>

<p><strong>1.Concentrate on posting daily updates but do strike a balance</strong> - If you post irregularly, your audience will lose touch with your brand and will
probably forget that you exist. On the other hand, if you post too frequently, your
audience might lose interest in your updates. You could notice a negative effect
on your engagement trends.</p>
<p>Always try to strike the right balance. At the same time ensure that your posts and
updates have a good chance to be seen by your desired target audience. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-metrics-improve" target="_blank">Leo Widrich</a>, it is advisable to post around 5-10 times a day on
Twitter and 1-4 times a day on Facebook for optimal outcome. </p>
