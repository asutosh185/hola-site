Just as every project starts with a plan, similarly every marketing campaign must have a <strong>clear documented strategy</strong> or
plan. We need to document what needs to be measured, when and how. Follow the SMART technique and make sure that
your goals are SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ACHIEVABLE, RELEVANT AND TIME BOUND. </p>
<p>Once you have your goals ready establish the action plan to reach there. Sometimes historical data also helps to do a trend
analysis and plan for future.</p>
