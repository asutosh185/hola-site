<p>We are designed to receive visual content better. Our brain focuses on visual 6X times faster than text.</p>
<p>When we hear information, we remember only 10% of that information three days later. However if a relevant image is presented with that same information, we tend to retain 65% of that information three days later.</p>
<p>The best way in online marketing is to use visual methods – photos, infographics, audio and videos.</p>
<p><strong>Photos</strong>: Create a compelling brand by using an impactful photo. Make your content more engaging using high quality images. Ensure the picture talks about your brand’s voice and style. It is always smart to include people in your images. To connect with your audience use images that evoke emotions. The image must show the trust and confidence that you are trying to build with your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Infographics</strong>: Simple text can be added to the photos and converted to infographics. The images can be used in the background to reinforce your point.</p>
<p>Publishers who use infographics get 12% more traffic compared to those who don’t. </p>
<p><strong>Use effective Audio to Brand your content</strong>. 30% of the audience are auditory learners. Audio can also be a major touch point between your brand and the customer. </p>
<p>The benefit of using such channels is that you can reach the people during their commute and it is easily accessible. It also works out cheaper for you than other marketing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Videos</strong>: We all love to watch videos. Chance of viewers to purchase a product gets 85% higher after they have watched the product video. 
You get full creative freedom when you make your own videos. It, no doubt, leaves a bigger impact on your audience than anything else.Creating your own video is an art. Websites like Hola Cards, animoto, powtoon, biteable, etc makes this art easy. </p>
