            <p>I admit it, it is frustrating. It is frustrating to see a fantastic product
              being advertised and then having to note down a number, dial it again
              to place the order. If I misplace the note, it would take a while for
              me to remember the product itself . How nice if I could just push a
              button on the advertisement and bingo, I am connected to website or
              sales person to complete the order. May be I am being lazy, may be
              it is just the Digital age expectation!

            <p><b>Call to Action (CTA)</b> is a term used of any item used to encourage audiences
              to respond and take action based on the information provided. Traditionally,
              in sales there is a human making this argument. Shops have call to
              action posters all over, even at some distance from the shop. Today,
              the world is going digital. More and more organizations are selling
              online. Computers, laptops, smartphones and other such devices are
              lifeline for many. Limited time to shop, traffic nuisance and hectic
              schedules are turning everyone to the Internet. CTA has now become
              important in the online world as well.</p>
            <p><b>The Art of Persuasion</b></br>
              Though a vast topic in itself, in very simple terms, persuasion has
                two aspects:
              <ol>
                <li>Providing information</li>
                <li>Giving the next steps</li>
              </ol>

</p>
              <p>In the digital world, a lot of information can be provided to the audiences
                in different ways, forms and sizes. But what about the next steps?
                CTAs are the answer. A CTA could be anything – “buy now”, “register
                today”, “subscribe now”, “get your code now”, “add to cart”.

            <p><b>The Psychology behind Call to Action</b></br>
              Many researches have shown that most of the shopping happens on impulse. According
              to eMarketer, about 80% of millennials have admitted that they are
              impulse buyers. A case study done by Versio2 shows that a renowned
              Swiss high school was able to get 12 times more leads per month on
              an average, with many marketing qualified leads. All because of strategic
              design and placement of CTAs.

            <p>An article published on Entrepreneur.com – “Why We Click: The Simple
              Psychology Behind Calls to Action”, explains that users click on CTAs
              because of compelling color, clickable copy, shape & size and prominent
              placement. These factors can increase or decrease the number of clicks,
              but if there are no CTAs, there will be no clicks.</p>
            <p><b>The Location</b></br>
              CTAs are important, but where? As marketers we require to persuade our
              audiences to take the necessary action from varied locations. Any information
              that is meant to result in an action should have a CTA. Your website,
              blog, newsletter, explainer videos, articles and other videos. CTAs
              are the “next step” for online buyers, so make them simple, attractive,
              easy to access and most importantly available everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>We can get more conversions when the action is just a click away. It
              is amazing how we can enhance the user experience with the use of a
              very small element. Good things come in small packages.. ?</p>
