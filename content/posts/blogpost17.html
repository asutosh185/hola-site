<p>The time has come to move to a realm of interactive video and leave static video behind. While it is true that static video is still an effective content strategy as 43% of people want to see more video content from marketers (source: https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics). But the customer expectations are changing. Interactive and personalized experience demand is on the rise. Interactive Videos meet this demand and help businesses to enhance customer relationships.</p>
<p><b>Higher Engagement</b></p>
<p>Interactive videos give control to the users. When users feel the control, they stay more engaged. Another trick is content tailored and customized to user needs. It can capture attention, motivate action and increase conversion ratio.</p>
<p>Companies that foster positive customer engagement always have the edge over competitors. While watching a video, more than 50% of the experience is based on emotion. Emotion drive decisions. Interactive videos help you to create emotionally engaged customers. These customers are 3X more likely to recommend the company’s brand and 3X more likely to repurchase the company’s product or service. </p>
